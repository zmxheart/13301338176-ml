<p><b><a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/">Pig</a></b> is a folk jeopardy dice game described by John Scarne in 1945, and 
was an ancestor of the modern game <b>Pass the Pigs®</b> (originally called <b>
PigMania®</b>). </p>
<p>The rules are simple: Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a 
player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and 
scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the <i>turn total</i>). At any time during a 
player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>roll</b> - If the player rolls a 
	<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's 
		turn. 
		</li>
		<li><b>2 - 6</b>: the number is added to the player's turn total and the 
		player's turn continues. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>hold</b> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it 
	becomes the opponent's turn. </li>
</ul>
<p>To familiarize yourself with play, you can
<a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/piggame.html">play an optimal Pig 
opponent</a> online. The key decision facing a player is how large a turn total 
should be risked to possibly get an even larger total. To learn more about the

		teaching treasure.&nbsp; Mathematics instructors have long used this 
		game to teach probabilistic concepts.&nbsp; We here offer a rich 
		collection of CS1 Pig exercises that illustrate bottom-up development.&nbsp; 
		Alternatively, one can approach the final &quot;Pig Game&quot; exercise as a good

<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>Creating variations of the these exercises is simple.&nbsp; One can both vary 
the simulated play policy, and/or rule variations.</p>
<p><b>Pig Play Policies:</b>&nbsp; Let <i>i </i>be the player's score,<i> j</i> 
be the opponent's score, and <i>k</i> be the current turn total.<i> </i></p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Hold at 25 or goal</u> - Hold at the lesser of 25 and 100 - i.</li>
	<li><u>4 Scoring Turns</u> - Let <i>t</i> be the number of turns in which a 
	player has held so far.&nbsp; Hold at floor((100 - i)/(4 - t)).</li>
	<li><u>Score Base, Keep Pace, and End Race</u> - If <i>i</i> &gt;= 69 or <i>j</i> 
	&gt;= 69, roll for the goal.&nbsp; Otherwise, hold at the greater of 19 and <i>
	j</i> - 14.</li>
	<li><u>Keep Pace and End Race</u> - If <i>i</i> &gt;= 71 or <i>j</i> &gt;= 71, 
	roll for the goal.&nbsp; Otherwise, hold at 21 + round((<i>j</i> - <i>i</i>) 
	/ 8).</li>
	<li><u>Optimal</u> - (advanced) see
	<a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/nsf/pig/index.html">Solving the 
	Dice Game Pig: an introduction to dynamic programming and value iteration</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Game Variations:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Piglet (a.k.a. Pigtails)</u> - Pig with a coin.&nbsp; A &quot;tails&quot; flip 
	is like a &quot;pig&quot; roll of 1.&nbsp; The holding player scores the number of 
	successive &quot;head&quot; flips.&nbsp; Use lower goal values (e.g. 10) and hold 
	values (e.g. 2).</li>
	<li><u>Two-Dice Pig</u> - This variation is the same as
	<font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Pig</font>, except: 
	<ul>
		<li>Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is 
		added to the turn total. </li>
		<li>If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn 
		ends. </li>
		<li>If two 1s are rolled, the player’s entire score is lost, and the 
		turn ends.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><u>Big Pig</u> - This variation is the same as
	<font face="Times New Roman,Times New Roman">Two-Dice Pig</font>, except:
	<ul>
		<li>If two 1s are rolled, the player adds 25 to the turn total. </li>
		<li>If other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the value of the 
		dice to the turn total. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_pigs">Pass the Pigs&reg;</a> 
	- This commercial game, originally called PigMania&reg;, uses small rubber pigs as 
	dice. Rolls are scored depending on whether pigs land on their feet, sides, 
	backs, etc. in various combinations.&nbsp; Data for relative frequencies of 
	these combinations are available from the statistical analysis External 
	Links of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_pigs">Pass the Pigs&reg; Wikipedia 
	article</a>.</li>
	<li><u>Hog</u> - Hog is played as Pig where, at the beginning of a turn, the 
	player decides <i>how many dice</i> to roll and rolls them all at once.&nbsp; 
	If any 1's (&quot;hogs&quot;) are rolled, there is no score for the turn.&nbsp; 
	Otherwise, the sum of the dice are scored.&nbsp; In either case, it becomes 
	the next player's turn.</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/piglinks.html#variants">
	list of Pig game variations</a> is also available.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the many ways the problem set above may be thus varied, it is not 
difficult to craft a unique (i.e. not easily plagiarized) assignment experience 
for your students.</p>

<p>With its simple rules and engaging play, Pig lends itself to many uses across
